## Data Visualization

This weeks THW meeting will give an overview of [python data visualization][data_vis_presentation] packages and best practices for plotting using matplotlib. There will also be a chance for everyone to visualize data in a group activity. To get the most from this activity, please bring a laptop with your preferred data visualization software installed.
