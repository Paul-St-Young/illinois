## Python as Glue
Python is one of the most versatile and popular languages for scientific computing as of 2019. However, being an interpreted rather than a compiled language, basic loops in Python are abysmally slow. In this tutorial, I will [present][1] one possible cure for this slowness. Specifically, I will use Python to glue together C and Fortran backend codes with matplotlib visualization frontend scripts.
