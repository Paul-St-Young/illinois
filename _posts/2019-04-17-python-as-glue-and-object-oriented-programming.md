## Python as Glue
Python is one of the most versatile and popular languages for scientific computing as of 2019. However, being an interpreted rather than a compiled language, basic loops in Python are abysmally slow. In this tutorial, we find [present][1] one possible cure for this slowness. Specifically, we will use Python to glue together C and Fortran backend codes with matplotlib visualization frontend scripts.

## Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a widely-used programming paradigm that emphasizes writing modular, flexible code. In today's talk we'll discuss some of the key concepts and advantages of OOP, with some concrete examples in Python.
