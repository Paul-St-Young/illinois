## Python Coding Challenge

There is no tutorial or formal discussion scheduled for this week. Instead, there will be a [coding challenge][coding challenge]. Challenge participants will receive a special prize from GitHub! This time can also be used to discuss previous THW sessions, discuss and work on personal projects, and get advice on any programming issues.
