## Presentation

[Docker][docker] is the most popular virtual machine (VM) image manager in 2018.
Docker can create a "container" (VM) with all dependencies for a specific app
and save an "image" (a snapshot of the VM) to an online [hub][hub].
This way an application can be ran on any machine irrespective of hardware and
software environment.

In this slide (link to come), I will first cover the basics:
  1. how to use existing docker images;
  2. how to create your own image using "dockerfile";
  3. how to "ochestrate" multiple images using "docker-compose.yml".

Then, I will show a practical application of docker in scientific computing.
Specifically, I will compile a simulation program with non-trivial dependencies
and show how it can be ran with analysis and monitoring programs on any machine
using a single "docker-compose up" command.
