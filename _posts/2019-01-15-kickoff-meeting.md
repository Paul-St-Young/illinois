## Kickoff Meeting

In this meeting, we will be picking topics for the semester. Brainstorm topics you would like to see or present. If you need inspiration check out what other [THW chapters][prev_chapters] have done in the past and our [single-question survey][survey] from last semester. We can repeat topics, go more in-depth with previous topics, or go into uncharted territory!
