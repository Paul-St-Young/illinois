## Automated Documentation and Software Testing

In this meeting we will see a presentation on automated documentation and software testing given by Shane Keniley and Nate Walter. An automated documentation generator makes it easier for you to create a standardized document that explains how your code works. Software testing checks if your code is actually doing what you expect it to. This is especially helpful when updating, upgrading, and working collaboratively on a project.
